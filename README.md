Madbox interview test

-I did the exercise with 4 and a half hours, the development was slower because I could not work from my desk and I only had one screen on the computer and I am used to having two.
-It was difficult having to use the FunRace3D game as a reference, this meant that it could not innovate much and had limited design.
It was also difficult to develop the game in 5 hours counting the design and development. I like to be creative and think of new mechanics and different games and with the limited time I have not been able to think to make an interesting design.
-I could make a game more interesting, more fun and better designed, I am not proud of the result because I have not been able to think to innovate and I have tried to ensure that the game had a beginning, an end, a playable level and that it was similar to the game of reference.
-If I could go one step further what I would do would be to think about how to make the game fun, innovative and look for it to be an attractive game for the public. I would also improve the code because with the time I have had I have made the code to ensure that everything works without paying as much attention to that it was well programmed.
-I do not feel comfortable with the result because I have not been able to show off my creativity and my programming abilities, I would have liked to have time to think, design something fun and then have 5 hours to develop it, so I could have stood out more and paid more attention to the design and the code.
